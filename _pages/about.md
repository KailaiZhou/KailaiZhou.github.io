Kailai Zhou received his Ph.D. from Nanjing University in 2025 under the supervision of Prof. Xun Cao. He is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Nanyang Technological University, working with Prof. Bihan Wen. His research lies at the intersection of computational imaging and computer vision, with a particular focus on spectral vision and its role in emerging areas such as AI for Science, embodied intelligence, and world models.

He seeks to fundamentally advance how machines perceive the physical world. By pioneering new imaging mechanisms and harnessing higher information dimensions, His work aims to break through the  limitations of traditional RGB imaging and surpass the boundaries of human-centric sensing.
